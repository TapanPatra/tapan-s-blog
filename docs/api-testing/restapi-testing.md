# Introduction to API Testing


API testing validates communication between systems without using the UI.


## Why API Testing Matters
- UI may work, API may fail
- Faster than UI testing
- Critical for microservices


## Simple Example (Postman)
- Method: GET
- Endpoint: /users/{id}
- Validate status code: 200


## Common API Defects
- Incorrect status codes
- Missing validations
- Security gaps
